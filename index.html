	<p>Dr. Barbara O'Neill is an American pulmonologist and professor. She is known for treating people without pills. At the same time, each of her patients gets well again. Besides famous patients from US, she also gets visits from patients from EU countries too.</p>
	
	<p>Dr. Barbara O'Neill rarely gives interviews and tries to give more time to her patients. However, the correspondent of our station was lucky - the well-known doctor agreed to answer several questions for those patients who do not have the opportunity to register at her clinic.</p>
	
	<p>Dr. Barbara O'Neill IS SURE THAT ABSOLUTELY EVERYONE CAN REPAIR THEIR OWN ALVEOLI AND IN THIS WAY IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH AND WELL-BEING. Such repairation helps to get rid of lung damage and cure 9 chronic diseases.</p>
	
		<p>How to repair alveoli, the doctor has described in the following. In addition, today's article will address the following topics:</p>
	
		<ul><li>To become 120 years old without tablets is possible!</li>
			<li>Why dirty lung lead to chronic incurable diseases</li>
			<li>Hidden and obvious signs of dirty lung</li>
			<li>MODERN METHODS FOR THE TREATMENT OF COPD PATIENT&nbsp; WITHOUT TABLETS</li></ul>
	
	<h3>Dirty lung - a terrible killer!</h3>
	
	<p><b>Dr. Barbara O'Neill:</b></p>
	
	<p>- I will give you some information that I hope will make you think!</p>
	
	<p>The most common cause of death is LUNG CANCER, and the main cause of its occurrence is NICOTINE. It’s the most dangerous substance in the world. This substance kills more people than alcohol and drugs combined.</p>
	
	<p>In 94% of cases, nicotine causes death in people under the age of 70.</p>
	
	<h3>Nicotine destroys health. If it did not irritate our lungs, we would all easily live to be 120 years old.</h3>
	
	<p>What is nicotine like and what is it? I will not describe this substance here because it is described in medical textbooks. Some people may think that nicotine is not a big problem, but the consequences of nicotine on the airways are terrible. I will describe everything in simple words. Imagine a drain pipe that corroded by rust for years.</p>
	
	<p>This substance enters the alveolar cells. At first, a small piece (20-25 years old) is stimulated, and then a larger and larger area of the lung is affected (25-40 years old), and the alveolar walls gradually become weaker and the elastic fibers deteriorate, consequently, at the age of 40 years, nicotine deactivates the alveoli by almost half. But even that is not so dangerous!</p>
	
	<p>It is much more dangerous that nicotine stimulates the nerves, causing bronchoconstriction and emphysema. Pathological processes occur in internal organs, which in turn lead to chronic diseases</p>
	
	<p>First there is emphysema, then there is chronic bronchitis, and some time later there is also stenosis of the bronchi. What usually leads to a drastic deterioration of human health. Most often this process is triggered by nicotine.</p>
	
	<figure class="Figure" style="text-align:center"><a href="{offer_link}"><img src="./blacklung.png" loading="lazy"> <span class="Figure-caption">Lungs affected by nicotine. COPD patients over 10 years, large areas of lung cells are deactivated!</span></figure></a>
	
	<p>It depends on the condition of the bronchial walls in the body. Shortness of breath occurs when the walls of the bronchial tubes lose their elasticity and are difficult to contract and expand. As the inflammation worsens, more phlegm is produced in the lungs. This can lead to blockage of blood vessels and even cause insufficient blood supply to the heart.</p>
	
	<h3>You can't avoid airway obstruction! Of all things, nicotine triggers a chain reaction of physical aging. In short, the loss of elasticity of the airways can shorten a person's lifespan.</h3>
	
	<p>NICOTINE, OF ALL THINGS, TRIGGERS A CHAIN REACTION OF AGING IN THE BODY. Of all things, airway obstruction shortens a person's life.</p>
	
	<p><b>Instead of 120 years (that's what human body organs are designed for), some don't even live past 70! </b>Especially people who already have COPD at the age of 40-50. By the way, this is one of the most obvious symptoms of the loss of elasticity of the bronchial walls.</p>
	
	<h3>Nicotine is not the only reason - These substances also destroy your lung cells!</h3>
	
	<p><b>Dr. Barbara O'Neill:</b></p>
	
	<p>Nicotine - is not so bad yet. There are other substances that hurt your lung!</p>
	
	<p class="center"><b>Terrible air environment</b></p>
	
	<p>People can also develop chronic obstructive pulmonary disease when air pollution levels are too high or when exposed for too long, e.g. long-term exposure to chemical fumes, vapors and dusts in the workplace can irritate and inflame your lungs. Sulphur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere damage airway mucosa and cells, and mucus secretion increases, increasing conditions for bacterial infection.</p>
	
	<p>The older a person is, the higher the risk of COPD. This is why older people often die from lung infections and heart disease.</p>
	
	<p class="center"><b>Viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma</b></p>
	
	<p>Viruses, bacteria and mycoplasma are important factors in the acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The virus is mainly influenza virus, and the bacterial infection is more common with Streptococcus pneumoniae.</p>
	
	<figure class="Figure" style="text-align:center"><a href="{offer_link}"><img src="./cell.png" loading="lazy"> <span class="Figure-caption">By the age of 50, cells throughout the lung become inflammed and destroyed. The more deactivated the cells are, the more chronic diseases you have and the faster the aging processes run!</span></a></figure>
	
	<h3>Check yourself! How worse are your lung cells and how high is the risk of an early death!</h3>
	
	<p><b>Dr. Barbara O'Neill:</b></p>
	
	<p>If you have never reduced inflammation and you are older than 50, you definitely have stiff airways. As soon as you eliminate inflammation, YOU WILL IMMEDIATELY FEEL AN EFFECT.</p>
	
	<p><b>Symptoms of COPD:</b></p>
	
	<ul><li>Shortness of breath, especially during physical activity</li>
		<li>Wheezing</li>
		<li>Chest tightness</li>
		<li>Chronic cough, which may produce clear, white, yellow, or green mucus (sputum)</li>
		<li>Frequent respiratory infections</li>
		<li>Lack of energy</li>
		<li>Unintended weight loss (late stage)</li>
		<li>Swelling of the ankle, foot, or leg</li>
		<li>Respiratory infection</li>
		<li>Heart problems</li>
		<li>Pulmonary hypertension</li>
		<li>Depression</li></ul>
	
	<h3>You claim that reducing lung inflammation can prolong the life of the elderly and increase lung activity?</h3>
	
	<p><b>Dr. Barbara O'Neill:</b></p>
	
	<p>- I know. We currently always prescribe lung inflammation elimination for all patients over the age of 50 (some over 40). Only after the bronchial inflammation has cleared up can we see what we can do next. About 9 out of 10 people are undergoing inflammation elimination and the airway returns to normal, requiring no further treatment.</p>
	
	<p><b>In other words, you no longer have to rely on herbs to keep your lungs healthy. All you have to do is remove the inflammation and allow the trachea wall to regain its elasticity with stimulate cells regeneration . Even if the elasticity of the airway wall doesn't fully return to normal (which sometimes happens), you will still feel better.</b></p>
	
	<p>Unfortunately, this simple method of normalizing the trachea is hidden by corrupt doctors and pharmaceutical companies, for whom long-term treatment and costing a lot of money are beneficial. Because the longer a person is sick, the more money he spends on medication. Eliminating inflammation is simple, inexpensive, and can get people back on their feet quickly.</p>
	
	<h3>American pensioner was cured of COPD by reducing lung inflammation and stimulating cell regeneration. And there are a lot of people like that...</h3>
	
	<p>I would like to show you a letter from American pensioner Heidi Farmer. Doctors at a local clinic have told her that she already does not have long to live. But her relatives continued to fight for her. The old woman could not visit us in person. Her daughter called our clinic and asked us for help. At the same time, I cannot even make a diagnosis in this way. We simply recommended her to reduce inflammation in the bronchi.</p>
	
	<p>3 months later, the woman has already written to us herself! I would like to show you her letter.</p>

		<p>"Thank you so much for giving me LIFE. When my daughter wrote to you, I was almost unconscious. I had trouble breathing even with the help of pills. I was not even admitted to the hospital, my daughter was told to prepare a place for me in the cemetery already. However, my daughter decided to call you. Then she started giving me the medicine you prescribed. Fortunately, the disease disappeared again. Meanwhile, my lung has completely normalized. Last week I even went to the hospital to get tested.

	<p>SUCH A MIRACLE CAN HAPPEN AFTER LUNG INFLAMMATION ELIMINATES. Although it is not a miracle at all - it can all be explained.</p>
	
	<h3>Method of eliminating lung inflammation for seniors and COPD patients.</h3>
	
	<p><b>Dr. Barbara O'Neill:</b></p>
	
	<p>- Today, there is only one drug in US that does this job well. It is called <a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a>. This drug was developed in 2015 by the American Institute of Health and contains about 40 active ingredients - extracts from plants useful for lung cells, vitamins, micro and macro elements.</p>
	
	<p>The most important component of "<a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a>" are the so-called "ACTIVE ACID MOLECULES" - they are able to eliminate cellular inflammation and restore cell wall elasticity, allowing it to expand and contract normally。</p>
	
	<p>The "active oxygen molecules" were discovered by Japanese scientists as recently as 2007. Two Japanese scientists were awarded the Nobel Prize for their research in this field. Today, "active oxygen molecules" are actively used in world medicine.</p>
	
	<p>Japanese began to pay more and more attention to the health of the lungs after the age of 40 as late as 1965, when the National Health and Longevity Program was adopted. Restoring the elasticity of the airways plays an important role in this law. And today we see the result of such a decision. Today Japan is a country with the highest life expectancy. 100 years is not a challenge for Japanese people at all. And if they used to get rid of lung inflammation with herbs, sports and yoga, now they use special medicines based on active oxygen molecules.</p>
	
	<h3>How long do you have to take <a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a> to eliminate lung inflammation?</h3>
	
	<p>On average, the course of intake is 2-4 weeks. However, this is all purely individual and depends on the well-being.</p>
	
	<p>This is what <a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a> does to your body during, as well as a few months after, reducing lung inflammation.</p>
	
	<p><b>Eliminates inflammation</b></p>
	
	<p>Due to the "active oxygen molecules" in <a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a> dissolves inflammed lung cells. Thanks to cannabidiol, the drug also repair thickened lung tissue after diminishing inflammation, or thickened bronchi, allowing air to be transported out of the air sacs (alveoli) in the lungs. After a monthly intake, research data show that the lung become as powerful and elastic as in young people aged 25 to 30. There is a restoration of small capillaries, no more daily cough and mucus (phlegm) production. This, in turn, leads to normalization of blood pressure, disappearance of weakness, drowsiness and diseases. Also, you get much more strength and energy.</p>
	
	<p><b>Restores the elasticity of the airway</b></p>
	
	<p>Ginkgo biloba extract in <a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a> restores the elasticity of the airways to allow them to expand and contract normally. Then you will not have difficulty exhaling and inhaling, and the air will no longer be blocked. Even doing outdoor activities, such as running, doesn't make it easy to feel short of breath.</p>
	
	<p><b>Restores alveoli</b></p>
	
	<p>After the bronchial inflammation is eliminated, the alveoli can also be repaired. "active oxygen molecules" promote cell regeneration, and alveoli damaged by irritating gases and particulate matter can be quickly repaired. As a result, many diseases disappeared. For example, symptoms of severe respiratory distress go away. Healthy alveoli help fight diseases like emphysema.</p>
	
	<p><b>Restores internal organs</b></p>
	
	<p>After the lungs are functioning normally, the rest of the body's internal organs can also recover. After the airway regains its elasticity and air delivery is no longer obstructed, blood can flow normally in the blood vessels. As a result, diseases such as pulmonary hypertension disappear, and the burden on the heart also dissipates. In addition, the legs and feet no longer feel swollen, and the mobility of the joints gets improved.</p>
	
	<p><b>Restores potency in men!</b></p>
	
	<p>One of the amazing consequences of cells repairation is that in men the hormone testosterone is produced again. Prostatitis and prostate adenoma disappear. In addition, the potency is also increased. So if you are under 70, you can have sex again.</p>

	<h3>Butterfly effect for elderly and COPD patients</h3>
	
	<p>The action of <a href="{offer_link}">Reviv CBD Gummies</a> resembles a stroke of the butterfly wing, which causes a chain reaction to improve the internal organs and well-being. Starting with the normalization of lung and ending with the restoration of vision and joints.</p>
	
	<p>1-3 months after eliminating lung inflammation - it's like a rebirth. At the same time, patients feel noticeable improvements every week.</p>
	
	<p><b>Light awakening</b></p>
	
	<p>You will wake up in the morning and get out of bed easily - you won't have to force yourself to do that anymore. You will be full of energy and strength.</p>
	
	<p><b>Excellent well-being and mood</b></p>
	
	<p>From morning and for the whole day. You can sleep well again. Feel young again. You don't need to go to the toilet all the time at night and you don't have pain anymore.</p>
	
	<p><b>Delicious breakfast</b></p>
	
	<p>Your menu will expand. You will no longer need to go on strict diets. If you eat something wrong, you will no longer have heartburn.</p>
	
	<p><b>Giant power</b></p>
	
	<p>When you leave the house, you will no longer have to worry about your legs. You will no longer perceive walking as a burden and your legs will no longer get tired or swell. No more shortness of breath and no more headaches. You will even be able to work in the garden.</p>
	
	<p><b>Absolute silence</b></p>
	
	<p>You will be calm and relaxed again. You will no longer have constant pain and will now have the opportunity to think about something else. When nothing hurts, familiar things, sounds and smells will play with new, long forgotten colors.</p>
	
	<p><b>You start to see perfectly</b></p>
	
	<p>Even severely damaged vision gradually begins to improve. Everything you used to see will seem much clearer to them. You will be able to see bus number again and admire nature.</p>
	
	<p>And now the most important thing - YOU WILL BE ABLE TO LIVE WITHOUT TABLETS. Forget about medications that lower blood pressure. This will be a thing of the past as blood pressure will stop fluctuating!</p>
